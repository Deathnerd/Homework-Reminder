Homework-Reminder
=================
This is a simple app that will I made to help me remember my homeworks. Run the index.php once to set up the tables, pop over to adminer to create the classes, and add send_emails.php to a cron job.

Oh, and you'll have to define the EMAIL_ constants that are called in send_emails.php in a mail_config_vals.php file.
Requires PHP 5.3+ with SQLite3 extension.
